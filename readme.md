# Cucumber.js Runner

Run [cucumber-js](https://raw.github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) in the browser or attach other reporters, similar to Jasmine.

## Status

HTML reporter done, [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.com) adapter should be done soon. Working on figuring out how to instrument the browser with [uitest.js](https://github.com/tigbro/uitest.js).
